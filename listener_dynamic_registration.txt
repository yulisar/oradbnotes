Let's have a Demo of Dynamic Listener.

The listener is quite capable of running without a listner.ora file at all. It will simply start and run with all default values.Here i have rename the listener.ora file and stop and start the listener and find that listener supports no services.Check the below: 

LSNRCTL> stop
Connecting to (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=tech-199)(PORT=1521)))
The command completed successfully.

Now start the listener

LSNRCTL> start
Starting tnslsnr: please wait...

The listener supports no services
The command completed successfully

Here, we find that listener donot support any services.Since it doesnot found the listener.ora file ,and  if we try to connect to the Instance then it will  throws the error i.e, ORA-12514 :

C:\> tnsping noida

Now, we try to connect with Instance "NOIDA"

C:\> sqlplus sys/xxxx@noida as sysdba

ERROR:
ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect
descriptor

Since the tnsping proves that our tnsnames.ora resolution is correct, but it throws the error while connecting to database because the listener doesnot knows anything about the services "NOIDA" . Let's start the instance and check again : 

C:\> set ORACLE_SID=noida
SQL> startup 
ORACLE instance started.

Now check the listener status again :

LSNRCTL> status

The command completed successfully

Here we observe that once the instance is started , when we re-check the listener now knows of service “NOIDA”, with a status of READY . This obviously did not come from listener.ora as the file is renamed. Notice also that, unlike the static registration, this time the status is READY. The listener knows the instance is ready because the instance itself told the listener it was ready. 

Now agian connecting to the Instance :

C:\>sqlplus sys/xxxx@noida as sysdba

Here by default, the PMON process registers service information with its local listener on the default local address of TCP/IP, port 1521. As long as the listener configuration is synchronized with the database configuration, PMON can register service information with a nondefault local listener or a remote listener on another node. During service registration PMON provides listener with the following information: 

- Name of the associated instance
- Current load and maximum load on instance
- Names of DB services provided by database.
- Information about dedicated servers and dispatchers (depends on database server mode i.e dedicated/shared server mode) .

PMON process wakes up at every 60 seconds and provide information to the listener. If any problem arises and PMON process fails then it's not possible to register information to listener periodically. In this case we can do 'Manual service registration' using command: 
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM REGISTER;
